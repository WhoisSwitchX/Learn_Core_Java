Relationship and Usage
Development: Use the JDK to write, compile, and debug Java code.
Deployment: Use the JRE to run Java applications on end-user machines.
Execution: The JVM, part of both JRE and JDK, actually runs the Java program.
Code Example
Here's a simple demonstration of how these components interact:

// This file is named HelloWorld.java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
To compile and run this program:

Use the JDK's javac to compile:

javac HelloWorld.java
This creates HelloWorld.class containing bytecode.

Use the JRE's java to run:

java HelloWorld
The JVM within the JRE executes the bytecode.
