Loop in java is a feature where we can execute a set of instructions repeatedly. 
Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.
Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.

While Loop: (Entry controlled loop)
            The Java while loop is used to iterate a part of the program repeatedly until the specified Boolean condition is true. 
            As soon as the Boolean condition becomes false, the loop automatically stops.
            The while loop is considered as a repeating if statement. If the number of iteration is not fixed, it is recommended to use the while loop.

class whileLoopx {
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        // initialization expression
        int i = 1;
 
        // test expression
        while (i < 6) {
            System.out.println("Hello World");
 
            // update expression
            i++;
        }
    }
}



Do-While Loop: If the number of iteration is not fixed and you must have to execute the loop at least once, it is recommended to use a do-while loop.
                (Java do-while loop is called an exit control loop.)
